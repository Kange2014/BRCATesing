The gene report format provides a list of RefSNPs for a single gene in a tab delimited fashion.

Column definition:

1. Submitter handle (dbSNP submitter ID):	A unique identifier , or "handle" for the submitter submitting the variant data.

2. GeneID:	The unique identifier for a gene from the "Gene" database.

3. Submitted HGVS name:	HGVS name provided and confirmed by the submitter for each variant.

4. Calculated HGVS name:	HGVS name computed based on the mapping information for each variant.

5. ss#:	Unique ID number assigned to each submitted SNP (variant).

6. rs#:	RefSNP ID, a reference identification(ID) tag assigned by NCBI to a group (or cluster) of SNPs that map to an identical location in genome.

7. Submitter's variant ID:	An identifier  provided and maintained  by the submitter for each variant.

8. rs MAF:	RefSNP Minor allele frequency (More details in: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/docs/rs_attributes.html).

9. rs Allele origin:	RefSNP allele origin (Allele alleles combined. More details in: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/docs/rs_attributes.html).

10. rs SNP suspect:	RefSNP suspect description (More details in: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/docs/rs_attributes.html).

11. Clinical significance:	RefSNP clinical significance (Allele alleles combined. More details in: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/docs/rs_attributes.html).

12. ss Create time:	Created time for submitted SNP (ss).

13. ss Update time:	Last updated time for submitted SNP(ss) (note: this time is affected by either update requested by a submitter, or by ss property update as a result of dbSNP internal processing).

14. rs Create time:	Created time for refSNP.

15. rs Update time:	Last updated time for refSNP (rs) (note: this time is only affected by rs property update as a result of dbSNP internal processing. It is NOT affected by the update initiated by the submitter).

16. dbSNP build number:	dbSNP build ID.
